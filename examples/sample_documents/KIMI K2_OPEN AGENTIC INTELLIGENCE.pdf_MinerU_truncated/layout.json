We propose the MuonClip optimizer, which improves upon Muon with a novel QK- clip technique to address training instability while enjoying the advanced token efficiency of Muon. Based on MuonClip, K2 was pre- trained on 15.5 trillion tokens with zero loss spike. During post- training, K2 undergoes a multi- stage post- training process, highlighted by a large- scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a joint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its capabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments."

This transition marks a departure from static imitation learning towards models that actively learn through interactions, acquire new skills beyond their training distribution, and adapt behavior through experiences [63] It is believed that this approach allows an AI agent to go beyond the limitation of static human- generated data, and acquire superhuman capabilities through its own exploration and exploitation. Agentic intelligence is thus rapidly emerging as a defining capability for the next generation of foundation models, with wide- ranging implications across tool use, software development, and real- world autonomy."

Pre- training must endow models with broad general- purpose priors under constraints of limited high- quality data, elevating token efficiency- - learning signal per token- - as a critical scaling coefficient. Post- training must transform those priors into actionable behaviors, yet agentic capabilities such as multi- step reasoning, long- term planning, and tool use are rare in natural data and costly to scale. Scalable synthesis of structured, high- quality agentic trajectories, combined with general reinforcement learning (RL) techniques that incorporate preferences and self- critique, are essential to bridge this gap."

Using MuonClip, we successfully pre- trained Kimi K2 on 15.5 trillion tokens without a single loss spike. We introduce a large- scale agentic data synthesis pipeline that systematically generates tool- use demonstrations via simulated and real- world environments. This system constructs diverse tools, agents, tasks, and trajectories to create high- fidelity, verifiably correct agentic interactions at scale. We design a general reinforcement learning framework that combines verifiable rewards (RLVR) with a selfcritique rubric reward mechanism. The model learns not only from externally defined tasks but also from evaluating its own outputs, extending alignment from static into open- ended domains."

Given the increasingly limited availability of high- quality human data, we posit that token efficiency is emerging as a critical coefficient in the scaling of large language models. To address this, we introduce a suite of pre- training techniques explicitly designed for maximizing token efficiency. Specifically, we employ the token- efficient Muon optimizer [33, 46] and mitigate its training instabilities through the introduction of QK- Clip. Additionally, we incorporate synthetic data generation to further squeeze the intelligence out of available high- quality tokens. The model architecture follows an ultra- sparse MoE with multi- head latent attention (MLA) similar to DeepSeek- V3 [10], derived from empirical scaling law analysis. The underlying infrastructure is built to optimize both training efficiency and research efficiency."

On the other hand, Query- Key Normalization (QK- Norm) [11- 81] is not applicable to multi- head latent attention (MLA), because its Key matrices are not fully materialized during inference."

First, we train a mid- scale 9B activated and 53B total parameters Mixture- of- Experts (MoE) model using the vanilla Muon. As shown in Figure 2 (Left), we observe that the maximum attention logits quickly exceed a magnitude of 1000, showing that attention logits explosion is already evident in Muon training to this scale. Max logits at this level usually result in instability during training, including significant loss spikes and occasional divergence."

A naive approach to increasing token utility is through repeated exposure to the same tokens, which can lead to overfitting and reduced generalization."

These prompts guide a large language model to generate faithful rephrasings of the original texts in varied styles and from different perspectives.- Chunk-wise autoregressive generation: To preserve global coherence and avoid information loss in long documents, we adopt a chunk-based autoregressive rewriting strategy. Texts are divided into segments, rephrased individually, and then stitched back together to form complete passages. This method mitigates implicit output length limitations that typically exist with LLMs. An overview of this pipeline is presented in Figure 4.- Fidelity verification: To ensure consistency between original and rewritten content, we perform fidelity checks that compare the semantic alignment of each rephrased passage with its source. This serves as an initial quality control step prior to training."

As shown in Table 1, the accuracy consistently improves across these strategies, demonstrating the efficacy of our rephrasing- based augmentation. We extended this method to other large- scale knowledge corpora and observed similarly encouraging results, and each corpora is rephrased at most twice."

The architecture follows a similar design to DeepSeek- V3 [10], employing Multi- head Latent Attention (MLA) [44] as the attention mechanism, with a model hidden dimension of 7168 and an MoE expert hidden dimension of 2048. Our scaling law analysis reveals that continued increases in sparsity yield substantial performance improvements, which motivated us to increase the number of experts to 384, compared to 256 in DeepSeek- V3. To reduce computational overhead during inference, we cut the number of attention heads to 64, as opposed to 128 in DeepSeek- V3. Table 2 presents a detailed comparison of architectural parameters between Kimi K2 and DeepSeek- V3."

Sparsity is defined as the ratio of the total number of experts to the number of activated experts. Through carefully controlled small- scale experiments, we observe that — under a fixed number of activated parameters (i.e., constant FLOPs) — increasing the total number of experts (i.e., increasing sparsity) consistently lowers both the training and validation loss, thereby enhancing overall model performance (Figure 5). Concretely, under the compute- optimal sparsity scaling law, achieving the same validation loss of 1.5, sparsity 48 reduces FLOPs by "

However, as the context length increases, doubling the number of attention heads leads to significant inference overhead, reducing efficiency at longer sequence lengths. This becomes a major limitation in agentic applications, where efficient long context processing is essential. For example, with a sequence length of 128k, increasing the number of attention heads from 64 to 128, while keeping the total expert count fixed at 384, leads to an "

Increasing PP introduces more bubbles, while increasing EP, as discussed below, incurs higher overhead. The additional costs are prohibitively high for training a large model with over 1 trillion parameters and thus we opted not to use DualPipe."

The warm- up and cool- down phases are handled similarly and the overall pattern is shown in Figure 7. Although offloading may slightly affect EP traffic due to PCIe traffic congestion, our tests show that EP communication remains fully overlapped."

We adopt K1.5 [35] and other in- house domain- specialized expert models to generate candidate responses for various tasks, followed by LLMs or human- based judges to perform automated quality evaluation and filtering.

Second, we systematically evolve [82] synthetic tools through a hierarchical domain generation process: we begin with key categories (e.g., financial trading, software applications, robot control), then evolve multiple specific application domains within each category. Specialized tools are then synthesized for each domain, with clear interfaces, descriptions, and operational semantics. This evolution process produces over 20,000 synthetic tools. Figure 9 visualizes the diversity of our tool collection through t- SNE embeddings, demonstrating that both MCP and synthetic tools cover complementary regions of the tool space."

To address this, we complement our simulated environments with real execution sandboxes for scenarios where authenticity is crucial, particularly in coding and software engineering tasks. These real sandboxes execute actual code, interact with genuine development environments, and provide ground- truth feedback through objective metrics such as test suite pass rates. This combination ensures that our models learn from both the diversity of simulated scenarios and the authenticity of real executions, significantly strengthening practical agent capabilities."

Based on the work of K1.5 [35], we continue to scale RL in both task diversity and training FLOPs in K2. To support this, we develop a Gym- like extensible framework that facilitates RL across a wide range of scenarios. We extend the framework with a large number of tasks with verifiable rewards. For tasks that rely on subjective preferences, such as creative writing and open- ended question answering, we introduce a self- critic reward in which the model performs pairwise comparisons to judge its own outputs. This approach allows tasks from various domains to all benefit from the RL paradigm."

This approach is designed to align LLMs with nuanced human preferences, including helpfulness, creativity, depth of reasoning, factuality, and safety, by extending the capabilities learned from verifiable scenarios to a broader range of subjective tasks. The framework operates using a Self- Critique Rubric Reward mechanism, where the model evaluates its own outputs to generate preference signals. To bootstrap K2 as a competent judge, we curated a mixture of open- source and in- house preference datasets and initialize its critic capability in the SFT stage."

The K2 critic then ranks all results by performing pairwise evaluations against a combination of rubrics, which incorporates both core rubrics (Appendix. F.1), which represent the fundamental values of our AI assistant that Kimi cherish, prescriptive rubrics (Appendix. F.2) that aim to eliminate reward hacking, and human- annotated rubrics crafted by our data team for specific instructional contexts. Although certain rubrics can be designated as mandatory, K2 retains the flexibility to weigh them against its internal priors. This capacity enables a dynamic and continuous alignment with its evolving on- policy behavior, ensuring that the model's responses remain coherent with its core identity while adapting to specific instructions."

On- policy rollouts generated from verifiable- reward prompts are used to continuously update the critic, a crucial step that distills objective performance signals from RLVR directly into its evaluation model. This transfer learning process grounds its more subjective judgments in verifiable data, allowing the performance gains from verifiable tasks to enhance the critic's judgment on complex tasks that lack explicit reward signals. This closed- loop process ensures that the critic continuously recalibrates its evaluation standards in lockstep with the policy's evolution. By"

While longer responses can enable the model to utilize additional test- time compute for improved performance on complex reasoning tasks, the benefits often do not justify its inference cost in non- reasoning domains. To encourage the model to properly distribute inference budget, we enforce a per- sample maximum token budget throughout RL training, where the budget is determined based on the type of task. Responses that exceed this token budget are truncated and assigned a penalty, which incentivizes the model to generate solutions within the specified limit. Empirically, this approach significantly enhances the model's token efficiency, encouraging concise yet effective solutions across all domains."

This strategy not only leverages the advantages of high- quality data, but also mitigates the risk of overfitting to the limited set of tasks explicitly present in the training regime. This augmentation substantially improves the model's generalization across a broader range of domains."

A high temperature allow the model to generate diverse and innovative responses, thereby facilitating the discovery of effective strategies and reducing the risk of premature convergence to suboptimal solutions. However, retaining a high temperature in the later stages of training or during evaluation can be detrimental, as it introduces excessive randomness and compromises the reliability and consistency of the model's outputs. To address this, we employ a temperature decay schedule, to shift from exploration to exploitation throughout the training. This strategy ensures that the model leverages exploration when it is most beneficial, while ultimately converge on stable and high- quality outputs."

The aggregate bandwidth required to keep overhead low reaches several petabytes per second. To address this challenge, we developed a distributed checkpoint engine co- located on training nodes to manage parameter states. To perform a parameter update, each checkpoint engine worker obtains a local copy of parameters from the training engine, then broadcasts the full parameter set across all checkpoint engine workers. Subsequently, the inference engine retrieves only the parameter shard it requires from the checkpoint engine. This process is illustrated in Figure 10. To enable this for a 1T model, updates are performed parameter- by- parameter in a pipelined manner, minimizing memory footprint (see Appendix G)."

By leveraging the dedicated checkpoint engine, the system also becomes robust to single- point failures, because an inference replica can restart without communicating with other replicas."

Generation- based evaluation is used for MMLU- Pro, SuperGPQA, TriviaQA, BBH, C SimpleQA, MATH, CMATH, GSM8K, GSM8K- Platinum, CRUXEval, LiveCodeBench, and EvalPlus. To mitigate the high variance inherent to GPQA- Diamond, we report the mean score across eight independent runs. All evaluations are conducted using our internal framework derived from LM- Harness- Evaluation [4], ensuring consistent settings across all models."

When dealing with hard reasoning tasks or unclear tool definition, the model may generate excessive tokens, sometimes leading to truncated outputs or incomplete tool calls. Additionally, performance may decline on certain tasks if tool use is unnecessarily enabled. When building complete software projects, the success rate of one- shot prompting is not as good as using K2 under an agentic coding framework. We are working to address these issues in future releases and looking forward to more feedbacks."

Leveraging the token- efficient MuonClip optimizer and a 15.5T- token high- quality dataset, Kimi K2 achieves stable, scalable pre- training. Post- training combines large- scale synthetic tool- use data with a unified RL framework using both verifiable rewards and self- critic feedbacks. Kimi K2 sets new state- of- the- art on agentic and reasoning benchmarks, establishing itself as the most capable open- weight LLM to date."

As shown in Figure 12, applying MuonClip has negligible effects on the loss curve, indicating that even aggressive clipping does not impair convergence or training dynamics with MuonClip.

Furthermore, evaluation on downstream tasks reveals no statistically significant degradation in performance.

(3) Reload: Inference engines simultaneously load parameters from the other IPC buffer."
